**Scaling up.** The advantage of the dual-index approach is that a large
number of samples can be sequenced using a number of primers equal to only
twice the square root of the number of samples. To fully evaluate this
mock community. We generated 4.3 million pairs of sequence reads from the
16S rRNA gene with an average coverage of 9,913 pairs of reads per sample
(95% of the samples had more than 2,454 pairs of sequences) using a new
